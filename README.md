Project Title: Customer Purchase Behavior Analysis using Descriptive Statistics
Project Description:
This project aims to analyze customer purchase behavior using descriptive statistical methods. The goal is to understand the patterns and trends in customer purchases, identify key characteristics of different customer segments, and provide actionable insights that can drive marketing and business strategy.

Key Objectives:
Understanding Customer Demographics: Analyze the demographic attributes of customers (e.g., age, gender, location) to identify who the customers are and how these factors influence their purchase decisions.

Exploring Purchase Patterns: Examine the frequency, quantity, and value of purchases over a specific period. This will help in identifying high-value customers, peak purchasing times, and popular product categories.

Customer Segmentation: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior using descriptive statistics such as measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode), dispersion (variance, standard deviation), and distribution patterns.

Behavioral Trends: Identify trends in customer behavior, such as repeat purchases, average spending per transaction, and the types of products most frequently purchased.

Lifetime Value Estimation: Estimate customer lifetime value (CLV) by analyzing purchasing patterns over time, providing insights into which customers contribute the most to revenue and which are at risk of churning.

Comparative Analysis: Compare purchasing behaviors across different customer groups (e.g., new vs. returning customers, online vs. in-store purchases) to determine key differences in behavior and potential areas for targeted marketing strategies.

Data Visualization: Create data visualizations such as histograms, bar charts, and pie charts to visually represent the distribution of customer purchases, demographic breakdowns, and other key findings.

Tools and Software:
Statistical Software: Python (Pandas, NumPy), R
Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn, ggplot2, Tableau
Data Sources: Transactional data from e-commerce platforms, CRM systems, or other business databases
Expected Outcomes:
A detailed report on customer purchasing patterns and behaviors
Identification of key customer segments with high revenue potential
Actionable insights for targeted marketing campaigns and product recommendations
Clear data visualizations to present findings effectively to stakeholders
